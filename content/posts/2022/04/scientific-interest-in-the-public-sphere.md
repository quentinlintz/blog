## Public Displays of Achievement

Displays of the enormous scientific potential have memorialized achievements since the Age of Enlightenment. The public sphere has always drawn full attention to scientific demonstration and revered its great and miraculous outcomes. Examples of this are prevalent today as innovation rapidly accelerates.

The latest display of technological achievement was February 6, 2018, the launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy test flight with Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster as the dummy payload. In Musk's own words, his goal was to launch "the silliest thing we can imagine." The launch live stream reached over 2.3 million viewers, making it the second most-watched live event on YouTube (just behind the Red Bull Stratos skydiving project in 2012). These spectacles are not merely clever marketing campaigns but have a profound impact on our epistemic curiosity: our desire for knowledge that motivates us to learn new ideas, eliminate information gaps, and solve philosophical problems.

Over a hundred years earlier, in 1903, the Wright Brothers struggled with a wall of public skepticism. Even after demonstrating their invention multiple times on the outskirts of Dayton, Ohio, many failed flight attempts advanced the public's belief that humans would never be able to fly. In August 1908, Wilbur Wright took his flying machine to the public eye at the Hunaudieres racecourse, five miles south of Le Mans, France. This successful exhibit made headlines worldwide and dispelled doubts about the practicality of mechanical flight. The Wright Brothers' demonstrated that their airplanes were capable of precise control that was unattainable with other machines.

The stories of these engineering feats promoted the popularity of modern scientific culture. Near the end of the Enlightenment, the Montgolfier brothers finished designing the first piloted hot air balloon, marking the origin and revealing the importance of public achievement exhibitions. In 1783 in Paris, two French men Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes lifted off in the world’s first hot air balloon. The flight was approximately 25 minutes, over which the balloon covered 5.5 miles at an altitude of 250 feet. Most importantly, the passengers landed safely. The impact of this incredible demonstration gave citizens of the French capital a look into the nearly miraculous results of scientific achievement. This event ignited 'balloon mania' and encouraged commoners' scientific experimentation, which aristocrats once dominated.

To better understand these historical events, we must look to the origin of organized scientific study in Europe on the eve of the Enlightenment. In late-seventeenth century London, a small group formed a club to promote "Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning."

## The Royal Society of London

The group of natural philosophers created the Royal Society of London under the royal charter of Charles II. Their motto fittingly reflected the beliefs of the committee _Nullius in verba_ ("Take nobody's word for it"), which stood for establishing facts through experimentation. The formation of the Royal Society represented a culture shift toward _primacy of existence_ and that things possess a specific nature that is discoverable through empirical evidence.

The Royal Society often held experiments and lectures open to audiences who paid to view them out of fascination and entertainment. The purpose of these events wasn't solely to entertain but to teach the principles of Newtonianism. At one event, before a solar eclipse, William Whiston lectured on the scientific discoveries of the solar system, which helped dismiss superstitious fear and replace it with scientific understanding.

The greatest purveyor of Newtonianism was John Desaguliers, elected to the Royal Society in 1714. Desaguliers held many experimental demonstrations and effectively illustrated the theories of the _Principia_ to the public across Spain, Sicily, Venice, Russia, and the Netherlands on a grand tour. Along the way, he was always careful to explain the principles behind the demonstration to avoid displaying science as mysticism or tricks. As he said in 1734:

>a great many Persons get a considerable Knowledge of Natural Philosophy by Way of Amusement; and some are so well pleas'd with what they learn that Way, as to be induc'd to study Mathematicks, by which they at last become eminent Philosophers 

Individuals began to understand the natural world could be studied methodically, and knowledge was attainable through sensory perception. They witnessed technological inventions make their lives more manageable and reveal the world's mysteries.

## Progress Today

Each story described in the first section echo what the Royal Society aimed to accomplish. Looking back through history, we see a new and brilliant display of scientific progress every decade that inspires and reminds us we still have more to learn about the world.

As a software engineer, I benefit from the multitudes of video courses and live streamers who demonstrate new tech stacks by _building in public_ such as Desaguliers bridged theory and practice almost three hundred years ago. Over the years, I've learned it's noble to publicize your work. Documenting your progress--both your successes and shortcomings--opens you up to a unique collaborative process only available in the Information Age, where you can receive suggestions at the speed of electrons. Watching software tutorials and live streams benefits lifelong students like me because it helps us understand the thought process behind decision-making.

The best example of the effect of the Enlightenment and the power of scientific achievement is the shift in wealth. In the eighteenth century, kings were the richest people in the world, and today, the richest people in the world are engineers.
